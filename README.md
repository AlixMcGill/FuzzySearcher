## Project Walkthough

### User Login

<p align="center">All pages reroute to the login page if a user is not currently logged in.</p>

### Create An Account

<p align="center">Users without an account can create a new one and are redirected back to the login page after creation.</p>

### Main Page

<p align="center">Once a user is logged in and auth is passed, the user is redirected to the main post page.</p>

### Filter Loaded Page Content

<p align="center">Allows user to filter currently loaded assets</p>

### Filter Search Posts Database

<p align="center">User can search the database for a specific post by post title</p>

### Create New Post

<p align="center">Posts contain a title and body. Characters update as the user types the content of their post.</p>

### User Profile Page

<p align="center">Contains all the logged in users post, first name, last name, and sum of all post likes.</p>

### Delete Post

<p align="center">Removes a post from the database</p>

### Liking Posts

<p align="center">Users can like and unlike posts. user likes do not persist on reload/relogin in current implementation. But post likes are tracked and updated in the database.</p>

## Unimplemented Features
<p align="center">I did not want to stray too far from the project requirements. However, here are some features I would have liked to implement but decided against, given the context.</p>

- Persisted likes per user.
- Individual profile pages when you click on a username inside a post.
- User bios.
- lazy loading posts (i.e. only loads 10 posts at a time. When the user scrolls to bottom of the page another 10 will be loaded.)
- some kind of following system
- salted and hashed passwords

## Key Takeaways / Issues
- <p align="center">I am almost certain i've implemented the Jwt wrong. It works but having a seperate cookie to store the username to create other api calls definately feels wrong.</p>
- <p align="center">This was the first simple CRUD app I've created and has definitely widened my view.</p>
- <p align="center">If I were to create this project again, I would definitely do a few things differently given my current knowledge. First, when retrieving the posts, I would set up my database queries differently. In the current implementation, Iâ€™m grabbing all the post information first and then fetching the usernames in subsequent HTTP requests. This should realistically be done in a single request and returned together. I could definitely see that becoming quite expensive if this were a scaling project. Second, I should have had better planning or workflow organization. There were definitely times when working on this project when, after completing a section, I did not know how to implement the next part or had to spend unnecessary time figuring out the next step. If I were to plan out my projects ahead of time, I would know before even starting which areas I need to read up on and could plan accordingly. Because of my approach, I ended up having to rewrite various aspects of the codebase in other files because I did not take the time to fully flesh out a comprehensive plan for the project.</p>
